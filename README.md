# ECON-Research-Project

This is a repository containing the data and code used in the capstone course of my second major in my undergraduate studies. 

The focus of the project is on weather-hedging derivatives, where a machine learning model based on past weather data in Hong Kong is built, followed by an introductory pricing model.
