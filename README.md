# ECON-Research-Project

This is a repository containing the data and code used in the capstone course of my second major in my undergraduate studies. 

The focus of the project is on weather-hedging derivatives, where statistical distributions are fitted based on past weather data in Hong Kong. These fitted distributions measure the frequency and severity of precipitation directly caused by typhoon in Hong Kong. An introductory pricing model is also introduced, with a worked example on a call option and a swap.
